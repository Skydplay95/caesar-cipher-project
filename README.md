DAY 8 OF 100 DAY PYTHON BY ANGELA WU
DAY 8 PROJECT : CYPHER CAESAR

I made the on in main.py

Angela Wu code : https://replit.com/@appbrewery/caesar-cipher-4-end

Overall, it's was a good project. I have learn a lot and it make me pratice what i have learned in the past few days. I'm happy that i succeed quasi integrality myself, I know my code can have a better optimization but i will improve myself through the courses and it will come with the practice. 


The project was decomposed in 4 parts: 
1)make the encrypt function
I struggle a little bit on the first part,because i have complexity too much my code, but after i understand a point and check each step by printing, it was smooth.

2)make the decrypt function
This part was easy 

3)put encrypt and decrypt function into one name caesar
This part was easy too but i needed to adjust my code 

4)improve user experience by adding logo and asking if he wants to continue or not
prevent the fact that user can put a high shift number
change only letter and not number or special character

The part of improving user experience, was pretty okay 
The part to prevent high shift number was okay, because i have already partially made it in my draft of the first part when i complexify my code

The part to check is char.isalpha(), was ok after i look throught the documentation

Thanks for reading it, if you have any comments or advice, feel free to tell me thank you.

Special thanks to Angel Wu who made a great course
